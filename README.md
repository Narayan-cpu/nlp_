## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Overview

This project leverages key Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze text data. Below are the core NLP concepts and preprocessing steps used:

### 1. Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting raw text into smaller units called tokens (such as words, sentences, or subwords). This step is crucial for transforming text into a format suitable for further analysis or machine learning models.

- **Example:**  
  Input: `"NLP is fun!"`  
  Output tokens: `["NLP", "is", "fun", "!"]`

### 2. Lemmatization
Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma), ensuring that different forms of a word are analyzed as a single item.

- **Example:**  
  Input: `"running", "ran", "runs"`  
  Output lemma: `"run"`

### 3. Stop Word Removal
Stop words are common words (like "the", "is", and "and") that may not carry useful information for analysis. Removing them helps focus on the more meaningful words.

- **Example:**  
  Input: `"This is a sample sentence."`  
  After stop word removal: `["sample", "sentence"]`

### 4. One-Hot Encoding (OHE)
One-Hot Encoding represents words as binary vectors. Each word is represented as a vector with all zeros except for a single one at the index corresponding to that word in the vocabulary.

- **Example:**  
  Vocabulary: `["cat", "dog", "fish"]`  
  "dog" â†’ `[0, 1, 0]`

### 5. Word Embeddings (WE)
Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture their semantic meaning. Unlike OHE, embeddings place similar words closer together in the vector space.

- **Example:**  
  Words like "king" and "queen" will have vectors that are close to each other, reflecting their semantic similarity.

### 6. Word2Vec (W2V)
Word2Vec is a popular technique for creating word embeddings using shallow neural networks. It learns vector representations such that words sharing similar contexts have similar embeddings.

- **How it works:**  
  - **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):** Predicts a word based on its context.
  - **Skip-Gram:** Predicts the context for a given word.

- **Example:**  
  Training on the sentence `"The cat sits on the mat"` will help Word2Vec learn that "cat" and "mat" may appear in similar contexts and should have similar vector representations.

These NLP steps form the basis for many text analysis, classification, and machine learning tasks in this project. By applying these techniques, we can transform unstructured text into meaningful data for further processing and model training.

All the examples and live models are available in the repository.
