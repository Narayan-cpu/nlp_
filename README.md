## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical area of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to interpret, process, and generate human language. The techniques implemented in this project facilitate the transformation of raw, unstructured text into structured data, which can then be leveraged for various machine learning and analytical tasks.

## Core NLP Techniques

### 1. Tokenization

**Definition:**  
Tokenization is the process of dividing raw text into smaller units known as tokens. These can be words, sentences, or subwords, depending on the application.

**Purpose:**  
Facilitates further text processing by standardizing input into manageable pieces.

**Example:**  
- **Input:** `"NLP is fun!"`  
- **Output:** `["NLP", "is", "fun", "!"]`

---

### 2. Lemmatization

**Definition:**  
Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma), ensuring that different grammatical variations of a word are analyzed as a single entity.

**Purpose:**  
Improves model consistency and reduces the dimensionality of the text data.

**Example:**  
- **Input:** `"running", "ran", "runs"`  
- **Output (Lemma):** `"run"`

---

### 3. Stop Word Removal

**Definition:**  
Stop words are commonly occurring words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that often do not contribute significant meaning to text analysis.

**Purpose:**  
Enhances focus on meaningful content by eliminating low-information words.

**Example:**  
- **Input:** `"This is a sample sentence."`  
- **Output:** `["sample", "sentence"]`

---

### 4. One-Hot Encoding (OHE)

**Definition:**  
One-Hot Encoding represents each word as a unique binary vector, with all elements set to zero except for a single element corresponding to the word's index in the vocabulary.

**Purpose:**  
Transforms categorical text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

**Example:**  
- **Vocabulary:** `["cat", "dog", "fish"]`  
- **"dog":** `[0, 1, 0]`

---

### 5. Word Embeddings (WE)

**Definition:**  
Word embeddings are dense, continuous vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships and context in the data.

**Purpose:**  
- Preserves word meaning and context.
- Enables modeling of semantic similarity and analogy relationships.

**Example:**  
Words such as "king" and "queen" are represented by vectors that are close together in the embedding space, reflecting their semantic similarity.

---

### 6. Word2Vec (W2V)

**Definition:**  
Word2Vec is a widely used technique for generating word embeddings using shallow neural networks. It produces vector representations where words with similar contexts have similar embeddings.

**Variants:**  
- **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):** Predicts the target word from surrounding context words.
- **Skip-Gram:** Predicts surrounding context words given the target word.

**Purpose:**  
Learns semantic relationships and contextual similarities between words.

**Example:**  
Training on the sentence `"The cat sits on the mat"` enables the model to learn that "cat" and "mat" share similar contexts and should have similar vector representations.
